Definition: Circuits where the output depends solely on the current inputs.
Design Procedure:
Determine input variables and outputs.
Create a Truth Table with all possible input combinations.
Derive and simplify Boolean expressions for outputs.
Implement the simplified Boolean expressions using logic gates.
2. Boolean Functions to Logic Circuits:
Convert Boolean functions to circuits using OR, AND, and NOT gates.
3. Optimizing Circuits:
Simplify Boolean expressions to reduce complexity, cost, and energy requirements.
Methods: Boolean algebra, Karnaugh Maps, Quine-McCluskey.
4. Medium Scale Integration (MSI):
Purpose: Perform common digital functions such as multiplexing, encoding, and decoding.
Examples:
Adders: Perform binary addition.
Encoders: Convert input lines to binary code (e.g., Decimal to BCD encoder).
Decoders: Convert binary code to output lines (e.g., 2-to-4 line decoder).
5. Encoders:
Definition: Combinational circuits converting input lines into binary codes.
Types:
Priority Encoder: Prioritizes inputs; highest priority input determines the output.
Decimal to BCD Encoder: Converts decimal numbers to binary-coded decimal.
Octal to Binary Encoder: Converts octal numbers to binary.
Hexadecimal to Binary Encoder: Converts hexadecimal numbers to binary.
6. Decoders:
Definition: Combinational circuits converting binary codes to output lines.
Types: Code converters, BCD to seven-segment decoders, relay actuators.
7. Sequential Circuits:
Definition: Circuits where output depends on current inputs and previous states, requiring memory elements.
Types:
Asynchronous Sequential Circuits: Outputs change independently of clock signals.
Synchronous Sequential Circuits: Outputs change in sync with clock signals.
8. Sequential Synthesis:
Process: Convert FSM (Finite State Machine) models into sequential circuits by defining state diagrams, optimizing state codes, and implementing memory blocks.
9. Example - Vending Machine Controller:
Description: Controls coin processing, product delivery, and change return.
FSM Representation: Models state transitions based on inputs and outputs from coin receivers, coin returns, and pop drop devices.
State Assignment: Ensures optimal circuit design by assigning binary codes to states.

Flowcharts and State Diagrams: Flowcharts can be converted into State Diagrams, which help visualize how systems behave and transition between states.

Algorithmic State Machines (ASMs): Used to design digital circuits like counters, showing how systems change states step by step.

Counters
Ripple Counters:

2-bit: Counts 0 to 3.
3-bit: Counts 0 to 7.
Decade (BCD): Counts 0 to 9.

Synchronous Counters:

2-bit: Counts up or down in sync.
4-bit: Counts 0 to 15 up or down.

Sequential LSI Components
ROM-Based Microcontrollers:

General Purpose: Uses ROM for state and output control.
Counter-Based: Uses counters for simple state sequences.
Preset Counter-Based: Adds preset lines for state jumps.
MUX-Based: Uses multiplexers for complex state sequences.
Microprocessors: General-purpose processors with fixed designs, used to control and process data, like the Intel 4004.
