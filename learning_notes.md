Summary of content
This CPU Visual Simulator lets you see how a computer's CPU works, how a CPU executes instructions step-by-step. 
It visually represents various components of a CPU like the Program Counter (PC), Instruction Register (IR), Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU), and more. Users can input binary instructions into the RAM and watch as the CPU processes these instructions.

Key takeaways
Starting the process: The simulation starts with the Program Counter, which tells the CPU where the first command is in memory.
Fetching instruction: Instructions are picked up from RAM and loaded into the Instruction  Register (IR), where they are decoded to understand what needs to be done.
Execution: The Control Unit reads the instruction from the IR, decodes it, and the Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) processes it.
Routing Data: The Multiplexer (MUX) directs processed data to the correct parts of the CPU.

Personal insights or reflections
Watching each part of the CPU work in real-time helped me understand how complex instructions are processed.
It made everything Iâ€™ve learned about CPUs much clearer and more interesting. I tried changing some numbers myself in the Program Counter and watched how the CPU reacted differently.
All this hands-on practice helped me understand things much better than before. Now, I can picture how CPUs work when I read about them.
