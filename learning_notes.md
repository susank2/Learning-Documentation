Link title: CPU Visual Simulator 

URL: https://cpuvisualsimulator.github.io/

Summary of content:
This CPU Visual Simulator lets you see how a computer's CPU works, how a CPU executes instructions step-by-step. 
It visually represents various components of a CPU like the Program Counter (PC), Instruction Register (IR), Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU), and more. Users can input binary instructions into the RAM and watch as the CPU processes these instructions.

Key takeaways:
1- Starting the process: The simulation starts with the Program Counter, which tells the CPU where the first command is in memory.

2- Fetching instruction: Instructions are picked up from RAM and loaded into the Instruction  Register (IR), where they are decoded to understand what needs to be done.

3- Execution: The Control Unit reads the instruction from the IR, decodes it, and the Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) processes it.

4- Routing Data: The Multiplexer (MUX) directs processed data to the correct parts of the CPU.

Personal insights or reflections:
1- Watching each part of the CPU work in real-time helped me understand how complex instructions are processed.

2- It made everything I’ve learned about CPUs much clearer and more interesting. I tried changing some numbers myself in the Program Counter and watched how the CPU reacted differently.

Feedback: This hands-on practice assignment helped me understand things much better than before. Now, I can picture how CPUs work when I read about them.
I also learned how to use Github and document my work.






Link Title: Visual Transistor-level Simulation of the 6502 CPU   and other chips!

URL: http://www.visual6502.org/images/pages/Apple_Lisa_341_0064A_COP421.html

Summary of content:
This resource provides detailed images and simulations of the 6502 microprocessor and the Atari 10444D 'TIA' chip and Motorola 6800,Apple Lisa 341-0064A (COP421) and more. It helps explain how these chips function and the history behind it.

Key Takeaways:

1- The Visual 6502 project simulates the 6502 microprocessor. The simulation provides an in-depth look at the processor’s operations.

2- The 3193A is a support chip in the NES, essential for the console's operation.

3- The Motorola 6800 chip was designed before the MOS 6501 and 6502.The project provided images showing the stages of delayering a single 6800 chip.

4- The 341-0064A chip in the Apple Lisa controls the keyboard, mouse, RTC, and soft power switch. It is a customized National Semiconductor COP421. Images of the chip were taken and stitched together to provide a detailed view of its structure. These images help in understanding the chip’s functions and its ROM contents.

Personal insights or reflections:

1- Watching the simulations and examining the images helped me understand how these chips process instructions and work together. Zooming in on the details was very educational.

2- The high-resolution images showed how complex these chips are. 

3- The detailed images revealed how many tiny parts come together to make a chip work which was very interesting.

4-This experience encouraged me to explore more about how different chips and components work.
